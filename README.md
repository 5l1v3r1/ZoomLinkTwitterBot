# About the Bot

This readme file contains information about the [@zoomlinkbot](https://www.twitter.com/zoomlinkbot) Twitter account which automatically replies to users that have tweeted publicly accessible Zoom meetings links warning them that their meetings might be subject to Zoombombing and encouraging them to harden security in order to protect their meetings. 

## Public Zoom Links

Direct share Zoom links are in the format:

zoom.us/j/**********?pwd=**************** <br/>

              ↑1             ↑2
              
The first string contains the meeting ID and the second string contains the meeting password.
